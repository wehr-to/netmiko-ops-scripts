These are the DONT's of network automation, if you do these things, it's bad luck for 7 years. Listen to me 

1: Don't hardcode IPs, passwords, or CLI commands 
- Makes your script rigid and unscalable 

2: Do not skip device/OS specific handling
- Do not assume show run behaves the same across IOS, NX-OS, ASA, etc
- Build per device logic when needed

3: Do not ignore return codes or command output 
- If a command fails and you do not check you will never know
if you do not error check, you will not have credibility

4: Donâ€™t Run Code Without if __name__ == "__main__" Block
Your script is now safe and modular
